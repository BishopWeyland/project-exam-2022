This is a project exam from the first year of the "front-end development" course at Noroff.

## Description

The assignment for the project was to develop a blog of my own choice. I chose to make a travel blog about locations in Japan and things to do there. I used my own images from my own trip. I was tasked with setting up a headless CMS through Wordpress for all the blog posts.

The assignment required:

- Home page
- About page
- List of blog posts
- Blog post specific page
- Contact page

The home page required a carousel featuring the latest posts.
The list of blog posts should only load 10 posts and have a button to load more posts.
The blog spesific page should be dynamicly built using a query string parameter. Images on the posts should appear larger when clicked and dissapear when you click outside of them.
The contact page form must contain:

- Name (Should be more than 5 characters long)
- Email address (Must be a valid email address)
- Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long)
- Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long)

There was an optional second part to the assignment.

- Adding a sort, filter or search to the blogs.
- Post data from the contact form to Wordpress
- Allow users to submit comments on a blog post, and post the data to Wordpress.
